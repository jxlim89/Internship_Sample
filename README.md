# DSO_Internship_JanApr24

The objective of the internship is to improve upon an existing system used to analyse video footage and predict the valence and arousal (VA) levels of subjects in social media videos. The project will eventually be extended into automated multimedia analysis to improve understanding of a subject's mental state.
